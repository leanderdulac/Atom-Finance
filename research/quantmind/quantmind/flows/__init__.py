"""Apex layer — composes configs / knowledge / preprocess on the SDK.

Each flow function (``paper_flow``, future ``news_flow`` / ``earnings_flow``)
takes a typed input and a ``<Name>FlowCfg`` and returns a knowledge item.
Cross-flow utilities live alongside:

- ``batch_run`` runs any flow over a list of inputs with bounded
  concurrency and aggregated results.
- ``BatchResult`` is the shape returned by ``batch_run``.
- ``UnsupportedContentTypeError`` is raised when ``paper_flow`` cannot
  route fetched bytes through the format layer.
